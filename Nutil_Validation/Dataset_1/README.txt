Dataset_1 was created to validate Nutil Quantifier for the parameters selected for the pilot of the 40 BXD mice. 
It contains atlas maps from the BXD-mice and segmentation files with objects of established size and anatomical location.
The intention is to test that the output of Nutil Quantifier matches the ground truth for the dataset.
