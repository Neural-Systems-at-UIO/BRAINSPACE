Dataset 2 was created to validate Nutil Quantifier (v0.7.0) for the parameters selected for the pilot of the 40 BXD mice. 
It contains atlas maps from the BXD-mice and segmentation files that are completely blue (100% coverage with a blue object of RGB 0,0,255).
The intention was to test that the object splitting feature works correctly with the parameters selected for the study.
In other words, every region should give 100% coverage.

Results: The Nutil results were as expected.
