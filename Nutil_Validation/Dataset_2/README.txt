Dataset_2 was created to validate Nutil Quantifier for the parameters selected for the pilot of the 40 BXD mice. 
It contains atlas maps from the BXD-mice and segmentation files that are completely blue (100% coverage with a blue object).
The intention was to test that the object splitting feature works correctly with the parameters selected for the study.
In other words, every region should give 100% coverage.

Results: The Nutil results were as expected.
